# Minimal To-Do List

>A clean, single-page to-do app using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**How it works:**
- Add a task (top of the list)
- Check to mark as done (moves to bottom)
- Uncheck to move back up
- Click trash to delete

**Get started:**
1. Download or clone this repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser

**Files:**
- `index.html` — structure
- `style.css` — styles
- `script.js` — logic

No build tools or dependencies needed.
